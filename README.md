This repository showcases my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects, which I continuously update based on my interests and available time. 
Currently, I've posted a project focusing on SMS Spam Classification. 
In this project, three traditional machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) and two neural network structures (LSTM, TextCNN) are explored. 
These models are evaluated for their effectiveness in classifying SMS messages as spam or not.
